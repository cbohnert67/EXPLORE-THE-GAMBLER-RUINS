### How to Use the Slot Machine Simulation Tool

This Slot Machine Simulation Tool is designed to model the behavior of gamblers using various betting strategies on a complex slot machine. It can be used to answer a variety of statistical questions related to gambling, betting strategies, and slot machine behavior. Below is a comprehensive guide on how to use this tool and the types of statistical questions it can help answer.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Define the Slot Machine:**
   - Configure the slot machine's payout probabilities, rewards, number of lines, and other features such as bonus triggers and progressive jackpots.

2. **Define Betting Strategies:**
   - Choose or create a betting strategy for the gambler. Strategies can range from simple fixed bets to complex approaches like the Kelly Criterion or pattern-based betting.

3. **Create Gamblers:**
   - Create gambler objects with an initial stake, a financial goal, a chosen strategy, and the defined slot machine.

4. **Run the Simulation:**
   - Define the number of trials for the simulation. Each trial represents a gambler playing until they reach their goal or lose all their money.
   - Run the simulation and collect statistics on win rates, average spins, and other metrics.

5. **Analyze Results:**
   - After running the simulation, analyze the results to answer specific statistical questions about the performance of different strategies, the likelihood of winning, and the expected number of spins.

### Example Usage

#### 1. **Basic Setup Example**

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define a slot machine with varying odds per line and a progressive jackpot
    payout_probs = [
        [0.5, 0.3, 0.15, 0.05],  # Line 1
        [0.6, 0.25, 0.1, 0.05],  # Line 2
        [0.4, 0.35, 0.2, 0.05]   # Line 3
    ]
    rewards = [0, 2, 5, 10]  # Corresponding rewards

    slot_machine = SlotMachine(payout_probs=payout_probs, rewards=rewards, lines=3, bonus_trigger=0.1)

    # Create gamblers using different strategies
    gamblers = [
        Gambler(stake=100, goal=200, strategy=KellyCriterionStrategy(probability_of_winning=0.6, payout_ratio=2), slot_machine=slot_machine),
        Gambler(stake=100, goal=200, strategy=PatternBasedStrategy(), slot_machine=slot_machine)
    ]

    # Run the simulation with 100 trials
    simulation = Simulation(gamblers=gamblers, trials=100)
    simulation.run()
```

#### 2. **Custom Bonus Rounds and Progressive Jackpot Example**

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Slot machine with a progressive jackpot and custom bonus rounds
    payout_probs = [
        [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1],  # Line 1
        [0.5, 0.3, 0.15, 0.05],  # Line 2
        [0.6, 0.25, 0.1, 0.05]   # Line 3
    ]
    rewards = [0, 5, 15, 50]  # Higher rewards due to increased risk

    slot_machine = SlotMachine(payout_probs=payout_probs, rewards=rewards, lines=3, bonus_trigger=0.15, jackpot_initial=5000)

    gamblers = [
        Gambler(stake=100, goal=1000, strategy=FixedSlotStrategy(bet_amount=10), slot_machine=slot_machine),
        Gambler(stake=100, goal=1000, strategy=MartingaleSlotStrategy(initial_bet=10), slot_machine=slot_machine)
    ]

    simulation = Simulation(gamblers=gamblers, trials=100)
    simulation.run()
```

### Comprehensive Example: Analyzing Betting Strategies with Progressive Jackpots

#### **Simulation Setup:**

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define a complex slot machine with a progressive jackpot and varying odds per line
    payout_probs = [
        [0.35, 0.3, 0.25, 0.1],  # Line 1
        [0.4, 0.35, 0.2, 0.05],  # Line 2
        [0.5, 0.3, 0.15, 0.05]   # Line 3
    ]
    rewards = [0, 5, 10, 100]  # Rewards with a big jackpot at the end

    slot_machine = SlotMachine(payout_probs=payout_probs, rewards=rewards, lines=3, bonus_trigger=0.1, jackpot_initial=5000)

    # Simulate gamblers with different strategies
    gamblers = [
        Gambler(stake=200, goal=2000, strategy=KellyCriterionStrategy(probability_of_winning=0.55, payout_ratio=2), slot_machine=slot_machine),
        Gambler(stake=200, goal=2000, strategy=MartingaleSlotStrategy(initial_bet=20), slot_machine=slot_machine),
        Gambler(stake=200, goal=2000, strategy=RandomizedSlotStrategy(min_bet=10, max_bet=50), slot_machine=slot_machine)
    ]

    # Run a large simulation with 1000 trials to gather significant data
    simulation = Simulation(gamblers=gamblers, trials=1000)
    simulation.run()
```

#### **Statistical Questions:**

1. **What is the win rate for each strategy?**
   - Analyze which strategy has the highest percentage of trials where the gambler reaches their goal.

2. **What is the impact of the progressive jackpot on win rates?**
   - Compare win rates in simulations with and without the progressive jackpot to understand its influence.

3. **How do the number of lines and varying odds affect the outcome?**
   - Experiment with different configurations of lines and payout probabilities to see how they impact the success of each strategy.

4. **Which strategy is the most consistent?**
   - Determine which strategy has the lowest variance in outcomes, indicating consistent performance.

#### **Expected Outcomes:**

- You might find that the **Kelly Criterion Strategy** offers the best balance between risk and reward, with relatively high win rates.
- The **Martingale Strategy** might show higher win rates but at the cost of higher risk, evident in some significant losses.
- **Randomized Strategies** could offer unexpected success rates depending on the range of bets and the gambler's luck.
